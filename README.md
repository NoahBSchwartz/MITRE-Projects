# MITRE-Projects
While I can't share the full code for many of my contributions, I'm able to give a brief overview of each. I worked on 4 different projects over 2 summers.

## Public-Facing Projects:
- #### Researching the effects of hospital locations on COPD: 
    1. I developed an Agent-Based Model in Netlogo to simulate individual patients on a large time scale.
    2. We used real hospital location data and population statistics for maximum accuracy.
    3. The simulation depended on more than 60 real-world variables (disease rates, hospital admittance, smoking population, etc.)
