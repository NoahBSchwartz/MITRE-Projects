## üè¢ Public-Facing Projects

### Researching the effects of hospital locations on COPD

1. I developed an Agent-Based Model in Netlogo to simulate individual patients on a large time scale.
2. I used real hospital location data and population statistics for maximum accuracy.
3. The simulation depended on more than 80 real-world variables (disease rates, hospital admittance, smoking population, etc.)

### Building a global object search engine

1. We built a tool to search for any object in any part of the world.
2. It can search for castles in Spain or carwashes in Peru or any of the other 3000 categories.
3. But the most important part is that anyone can add and display their own data instantly.

## üîí Classified Projects

1. I built software to visualize missile defense data.
2. I worked with virtual machines for use in cybersecurity applications.

## ü§ñ AI Hackathons

1. Our team trained a Random Forest Classifier to spot phishing URLs. We attained over 96% accuracy!
2. On my own, I built a framework to increase the intelligence of a language model and ended the hackathon with a working coding bot.
